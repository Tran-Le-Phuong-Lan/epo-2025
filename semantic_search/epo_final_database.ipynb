to produce two phases, a first phase comprising aqueous sulphuric acid and a second phase comprising sulphur dioxide containing dissolved hydrogen iodide separating the two phases and recovering sulphuric acid and hydrogen iodide respectively from the two phases characterised in that at least one waterinsoluble organic compound selected from trialkyl phosphates and dialkylalkyl phosphonates and mixtures thereof, is added to the reaction mixture.a process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the variable parameters of the process, including the quantity of the organic compound employed, are selected such as to produce a sulphuric acid phase having a concentration of at least 40 by weight hzso4.a process as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the organic compound or one of the organic compounds employed is tributyl phosphate.a process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the organic compound is diluted with an organic sovent.the use of the hydrogen iodide produced and separated by the process claimed in any one of the preceding claims, for the production of hydrogen by decomposition of the hydrogen iodide into hydrogen and iodine.the use of the sulphuric acid produced and separated by the process claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, for the production of oxygen by decomposition of the sulphuric acid into sulphur dioxide, water and oxygen.', 'inventor':

      "      claim: a process for converting methanol to olefins comprising passing a methanolcontaining feedstock over a catalyst capable of converting methanol to a product including ethylene and propylene, wherein from 0.05 to 0.5 weight percent of ammonia is included in the methanolcontaining feedstock, such that the ratio of ethylene to propylene in the product is increased in comparison with the product of a process that is otherwise identical but lacks ammonia in the methanolcontaining feedstock wherein a catalyst selected from sapo molecular sieves and metalsubstituted sapo molecular sieves is employed.the process of claim 1 wherein the conditions include a temperature from 200 c to 700 c, a pressure from 0.01 megapascals to 2 megapascals, or both.the process of claim 1 or 2, wherein the methanolcontaining feedstock and the ammonia are in the vapor phase, liquid phase, or a mixed vaporliquid phase.the process of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the ratio of ethylene to propylene is increased by at least 5 percent by weight.the process of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein a sapo34 molecular sieve catalyst is employed.\n",
