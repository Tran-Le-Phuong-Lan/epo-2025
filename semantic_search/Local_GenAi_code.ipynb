I remember collecting cards, playing the games, and watching the anime. I was a big fan. But as I grew up, I started to lose interest. I don't know if it was because I got older and my interests changed, or if it was because the franchise started to become too commercial and lost its original appeal. But either way, I stopped following Pokemon and moved on to other things.\\n\\nBut recently, I've started to get interested in Pokemon again. It all started when I saw the announcement for the new Pokemon Sword and Shield games. I was immediately drawn in by the beautiful graphics and the new characters. I started to watch some YouTube videos and read some articles about the game, and I realized that I still had a lot of love for Pokemon deep down.\\n\\nSo, I decided to give it another try and downloaded the latest Pokemon Go game on my phone. At first, I was a bit hesitant because I was worried that it would be too hard or that I wouldn't be able to catch up with all the new updates. But as I started to play, I was pleasantly surprised. It was easy to understand and the gameplay was fun and engaging. I started to catch Pokemon, battle other trainers, and explore my neighborhood in a whole new way.\\n\\nI have to admit, it feels really good to be back into Pokemon. It's a great way to relax and have some fun, and it brings back memories of when I was a kid. I'm really looking forward to playing the new Sword and Shield games when they come out, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for this franchise.
