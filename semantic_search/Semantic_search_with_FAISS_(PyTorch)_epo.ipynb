            "DESCRIPTION: nucleic acids include those with positive backbones, non-ionic backbones, and non-ribose backbones. See, e.g., Denpcy et al., 1995, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:6097; Jeffs et al., 1994, J. Biomolecular NMR 34:17; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,386,023, 5,235,033 and 5,034,506. Modifications of the ribose-phosphate backbone may be done to facilitate the addition of labels, or to increase the stability and half-life of such molecules in physiological environments.In some embodiments, peptide nucleic acids (PNA) may be used for nucleic acids in the present invention. The PNA backbones are substantially non-ionic under neutral conditions, in contrast to the highly charged phosphodiester backbone of naturally occurring nucleic acids. This results in two advantages. First, the PNA backbone exhibits improved hybridization kinetics. PNAs have larger changes in the melting temperature (Tm) for mismatched versus perfectly matched basepairs. DNA and RNA typically exhibit a 2-4°C drop in Tm for an internal mismatch. With the non-ionic PNA backbone, the drop is closer to 7-9°C. This allows for better detection of mismatches. Similarly, due to their non-ionic nature, hybridization of the bases attached to these backbones is relatively insensitive to salt concentration.Nucleic acids may be single stranded or double stranded, as specified, or contain portions of both double stranded or single stranded sequence. Nucleic acids may be DNA, genomic DNA, cDNA, RNA or a hybrid. Nucleic acids may contain any combination of deoxyribo- and ribo-nucleotides, and any combination of bases, including uracil, adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, inosine, xanthanine, hypoxanthine, isocytosine, isoguanine, etc. In one embodiment, nucleic acids utilize isocytosine and isoguanine in nucleic acids designed to be complementary to other probes, rather than target sequences, as this reduces non-specific hybridization, as is generally described in U.S. Patent No. 5,681,702. As used herein, the term \"nucleoside\" includes nucleotides as well as nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, and modified nucleosides such as amino modified nucleosides. In addition, \"nucleoside\" includes non-naturally occurring analog structures. Thus, for example, the individual units of a peptide nucleic acid, each containing a base, are referred to herein as a nucleoside.In some embodiments, the methods according to the present invention are directed to the multiplexed detection of target nucleic acids. The term \"target nucleic acid\" or\n",

            "DESCRIPTION: example, the presence, absence or quantity of more than about 48, 96, 192, 384 or more target nucleic acids in the sample may be assayed in a multiplexed manner. The probes corresponding to all the target nucleic acids may be added to the sample and a single ligation reaction is performed to obtain ligation products for all the target nucleic acids.The sample to be assayed may be a sample of a bodily fluid, a biopsy tissue, or a paraffin-embedded tissue from an animal. The bodily fluid may be blood, plasma, serum, urine, sputum, spinal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, nipple aspirates, lymph fluid, fluid of the respiratory, intestinal, or genitourinary tracts, tear fluid, saliva, breast milk, fluid from the lymphatic system, semen, cerebrospinal fluid, intra-organ system fluid, ascitic fluid, tumor cyst fluid, amniotic fluid, or combinations thereof from an animal, e.g., a human.In some embodiments, nucleic acids are extracted from the sample before forming a mixture with the set of probes. The target nucleic acid may be DNA, RNA, or cDNA. The RNA may be reverse transcribed into cDNA before forming a mixture with the set of probes.In some embodiments, at least one primer of the set of primers is labeled with a detectable moiety, e.g., an oligonucleotide tag or a fluorescent dye. The fluorescent dye may be FAM (5-or 6-carboxyfluorescein), VIC, NED, PET, Fluorescein, FITC, IRD-700/800, CY3, CY5, CY3.5, CY5.5, HEX, TET, TAMRA, JOE, ROX, BODIPY TMR, Oregon Green, Rhodamine Green, Rhodamine Red, Texas Red, or Yakima Yellow. In other embodiments, at least one primer of the set of primers includes a stuffer sequence. The stuffer sequence in some primers may have about 10 to about 500 nucleotides. The stuffer sequence in other primers may be about 10 to about 60 nucleotides. In some preferred embodiments, no primer has more than about 125 nucleotides, preferably about 75 nucleotides. In still other embodiments, at least one primer of the set of primers includes an oligonucleotide comprising a sequence GTTTCTT or a functional equivalent variant of the oligonucleotide comprising a sequence GTTTCTT.In further embodiments, at least one probe of the set of probes includes a stuffer sequence.

            "DESCRIPTION: nucleic acid to be introduced into prokaryotic and/or into eukaryotic cells and, where appropriate, be integrated into a genome. Such vectors are preferably replicated and/or expressed in the cell. Vectors include plasmids, phagemids, bacteriophages or viral genomes. The term \"plasmid\" as used herein relates generally to a construct of extrachromosomal genetic material, usually a circular DNA duplex, which can replicate independently of chromosomal DNA. In one embodiment, the vector is an expression vector.The term \"host cell\" relates to any cell which can be transformed or transfected with an exogenous nucleic acid, preferably DNA or RNA. The term \"host cell\" includes prokaryotic (e.g. E. coli) or eukaryotic cells (e.g. mammalian cells, especially human cells, yeast cells and insect cells). Mammalian cells such as human cells, mouse cells, hamster cells, pig cells, goat cells and primate cells are particularly preferred. The cells can be derived from a large number of tissue types and include primary cells and cell lines. Specific examples include keratinocytes, peripheral blood leukocytes, bone marrow stem cells and embryonic stem cells. In further embodiments, the host cell is an antigen-presenting cell, where the term \"antigen-presenting cell\" includes dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages. A nucleic acid may be present in the host cell in a single or in a plurality of copies and is expressed in one embodiment in the host cell.According to the invention there is further provided a diagnostic device comprising a panel of isolated peptides as defined above, wherein, preferably, the panel of isolated peptides is immobilized on a support.According to the present invention, a diagnostic device can take different forms, and it can be varied depending on the precise nature of the assay being performed. For example, the isolated peptide as disclosed herein may be coated onto a solid support, typically nitrocellulose or other hydrophobic porous material. Alternatively, the peptide may be coated on a synthetic plastics material, multi-well plate, microtitre assay plate, microarray chip, latex bead, filter comprising a cellulosic or synthetic polymeric material, glass or plastic slide, dipstick, capillary fill device and the like. Coating of the peptides to these surfaces can be accomplished by methods known in the art. Protein carriers are\n",

            "DESCRIPTION: nucleic acids include those with positive backbones, non-ionic backbones, and non-ribose backbones. See, e.g., Denpcy et al., 1995, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:6097; Jeffs et al., 1994, J. Biomolecular NMR 34:17; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,386,023, 5,235,033 and 5,034,506. Modifications of the ribose-phosphate backbone may be done to facilitate the addition of labels, or to increase the stability and half-life of such molecules in physiological environments.In some embodiments, peptide nucleic acids (PNA) may be used for nucleic acids in the present invention. The PNA backbones are substantially non-ionic under neutral conditions, in contrast to the highly charged phosphodiester backbone of naturally occurring nucleic acids. This results in two advantages. First, the PNA backbone exhibits improved hybridization kinetics. PNAs have larger changes in the melting temperature (Tm) for mismatched versus perfectly matched basepairs. DNA and RNA typically exhibit a 2-4°C drop in Tm for an internal mismatch. With the non-ionic PNA backbone, the drop is closer to 7-9°C. This allows for better detection of mismatches. Similarly, due to their non-ionic nature, hybridization of the bases attached to these backbones is relatively insensitive to salt concentration.Nucleic acids may be single stranded or double stranded, as specified, or contain portions of both double stranded or single stranded sequence. Nucleic acids may be DNA, genomic DNA, cDNA, RNA or a hybrid. Nucleic acids may contain any combination of deoxyribo- and ribo-nucleotides, and any combination of bases, including uracil, adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, inosine, xanthanine, hypoxanthine, isocytosine, isoguanine, etc. In one embodiment, nucleic acids utilize isocytosine and isoguanine in nucleic acids designed to be complementary to other probes, rather than target sequences, as this reduces non-specific hybridization, as is generally described in U.S. Patent No. 5,681,702. As used herein, the term \"nucleoside\" includes nucleotides as well as nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, and modified nucleosides such as amino modified nucleosides. In addition, \"nucleoside\" includes non-naturally occurring analog structures. Thus, for example, the individual units of a peptide nucleic acid, each containing a base, are referred to herein as a nucleoside.In some embodiments, the methods according to the present invention are directed to the multiplexed detection of target nucleic acids. The term \"target nucleic acid\" or\n",
